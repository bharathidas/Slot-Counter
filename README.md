## **Slot Counter**

Counter is a widget that helps you add animated and interactive number displays to your web applications. It's easy to use, works with different types of data, and lets you customize the animations to make your numbers stand out.

### Features

The value to be displayed.

The initial value to be displayed before the animation starts. It sets the beginning of the slot machine animation.

If set to true, the animation starts from the startValue only for the first render. For subsequent animations, it starts from the last value.

The duration of the animation in seconds.
